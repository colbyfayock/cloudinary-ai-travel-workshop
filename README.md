## üß∞ Before the Workshop

There are a few things you'll want to make sure you'll have prepped before we jump into the workshop.

First off, you'll want to make sure that you meet the miminum environment requirements in the section below. Basically, you should be able to use npm for working with projects locally on your machine.

You'll also want to make sure you have signed up for a free acount with [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)

While you _can_ do these things during the workshop, you risk the chance that you'll fall behind while we're working through the curriculum.

### Environment Requirements

There are three things that are probably considered "strict" requirements for the workshop:
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

This means that you should have basic familiar with a terminal as we'll be using it to run commands.

The **operating system** you use shouldn't matter as long as you can run commands with npm (or yarn if that's your thing).

If you can run `npm -v`, you should be good to go.

You can confirm you're development environment is ready to go by using [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) to test creating a new Next.js app.

```
npx create-next-app
```

We'll be doing something similar to start off our project and if that works, the rest should work!

### Setting Up the Project

For our project, we're going to be starting from "scratch".

Scratch is importantly in quotes, as we'll be creating a new project using a Starter template so that we can focus on learning how to integrate the tools of the workshop instead of building an interface around it.

If you want to start this project ahead of time to start poking around or even cusotmize it a bit to your liking, you can get started with:

```
npx create-next-app@latest my-travel-ai -e https://github.com/colbyfayock/demo-travel-workshop-starter
```

## üñ• The Workshop

### Lessons Structure

The lessons directory includes a bunch of markdown files which includes instructions for how we'll progress through the workshop. We'll be working through these exercises together throughout the workshop.

As far as the project we'll create and work through together, you're welcome to choose where you run the Create Next App command, whether that's outside of this repository or within it. A good rule of thumb might be to create the project where you would typically create new web apps or sites.
